1.Present the overall approach of the analysis in a presentation. Mention the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly.

2.Identify the missing data and use appropriate method to deal with it. (Remove columns/or replace it with an appropriate value)

3.Hint: Note that in EDA, since it is not necessary to replace the missing value, but if you have to replace the missing value, what should be the approach. Clearly mention the approach.

4.Identify if there are outliers in the dataset. Also, mention why do you think it is an outlier. Again, remember that for this exercise, it is not 
necessary to remove any data points.

5.Identify if there is data imbalance in the data. Find the ratio of data imbalance.

6.Hint: How will you analyse the data in case of data imbalance? You can plot more than one type of plot to analyse the different aspects due to data 
  imbalance. For example, you can choose your own scale for the graphs, i.e. one can plot in terms of percentage or absolute value. Do this analysis for 
  the ‘Target variable’ in the dataset ( clients with payment difficulties and all other cases). Use a mix of univariate and bivariate analysis etc.

7.Hint: Since there are a lot of columns, you can run your analysis in loops for the appropriate columns and find the insights.

8.Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.

9.Find the top 10 correlation for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable). Note that you have to find the 
  top correlation by segmenting the data frame w.r.t to the target variable and then find the top correlation for each of the segmented data and 
  find if any insight is there.  Say, there are 5+1(target) variables in a dataset: Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4, Var5, Target. And if you have to find 
  top 3 correlation, it can be: Var1 & Var2, Var2 & Var3, Var1 & Var3. Target variable will not feature in this correlation as it is a categorical 
  variable and not a continuous variable which is increasing or decreasing.

10.Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation. You are free to choose the graphs which explain the 
   numerical/categorical variables. Insights should explain why the variable is important for differentiating the clients with payment difficulties
   with all other cases.


In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong 
indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
